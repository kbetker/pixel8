			p Frontend Overview
			div
			p The frontend is built based off inspiration from the user submitted articles site, Medium.com. All logos, designs, and UI have been designed by one of our team members, Kevin Betker.
			div
			p Styling was handled using CSS in JavaScript.
			div
			div
			p Backend Overview
			div
			p The Express backend is a collection of RESTful routes serving data to the frontend and an interface with the sequelize database.
			div
			p Seed data was hand coded by team effort to flesh out all articles, comments, and user-base. The seed data was of particular importance to this application because we needed a lot of articles and even more users in order to have a good sorting basis.
			div
			p Conclusion
			div
			p Pixel8 was a lot of fun to make because our team worked very well together to delegate and spread out all tasks as equally as possible, with everyone on the team contributing to every portion of the project together. Every person on the team was able to contribute to every single task to create the website, including seeder data, CSS, front end mapping and design, as well as back end routing.
